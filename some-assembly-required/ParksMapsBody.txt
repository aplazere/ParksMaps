                README HERE!!

                This is a project created by Adam Lazere in 2023, it utilizes two python scripts (new_scraper.py and visualizeDistricts_v3.py)

                If you are tech savvy enough to find this and would like to get in contact with Adam his email is aplazere@gmail.com

                he may or may not ignore you

                However, if you have access to the code he wrote and are wanting to generate a map like this one know that it will require some manual correction at the html level

                for starters, if you would like your map to be searchable you will need to add a seperate search layer using these lines of code
                
                ##
                var searchLayer=new L.LayerGroup();

                for (i in searchData) {
                    var name = searchData[i].Name,
                    loc = searchData[i].loc,
                    marker = new L.Marker(new L.latLng(loc),{Name: name});
                    marker.setOpacity(0);
                    var icon = marker.options.icon;
                    icon.options.iconSize = [0, 0];
                    marker.setIcon(icon)
                    searchLayer.addLayer(marker)
                    //searchLayer.setOpacity(0);
                }
                map.addLayer(searchLayer)
                ##

                where searchData is a 2xn array formatted as such
                [{"loc":[lat,lng],	"Name" :  Park Name},
                {"loc":[lat,lng],	"Name" :  Park Name},
                                                    etc...]


                Additionally, you will need to manually add a layer controller

                here is the code for that

                ##
            
                var layer_control = {
                    base_layers : {
                        "openstreetmap" : tile_streetmap,
                    },
                    overlays :  {
                        "Districts" : district_layer,
                        "Parks" : basePark_layer,
                        "Has Dogrun?" : hasDogrun_layer,
                        "Has Restroom??" : hasRestroom_layer,
                    },
                };
                var controller = L.control.layers(
                    layer_control.base_layers,
                    layer_control.overlays,
                    {"autoZIndex": true, "collapsed": true, "position": "topright"}
                ).addTo(Qmap);
               ##

               to get this to work you may need to change what the layers are called. Additionally if you would like any of the layers to be unchecked automatically simply remove the ".addTo(map)" portion of their generation function
               and below the layer controller add a corresponding line that goes something like this

               ##
               controller.addOverlay(hasDogrun_layer, "Has Dogrun?" )
               ##
           
               happy coding!
